        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My mental is unstable and I'm into Gothic, Rock (Korn) and Tabletop (Warhammer 40K).</p>

        <h2>Videos</h2>
            <h3>The Horror Story</h3>
            <video controls src="Twine gameplay.mp4" width="500"></video>
            <p>The Horror Story is a funny point of view when I as a horror movie and book enthusiast react to bad writing from horror books and movies.</p>
            <h3>The Bed</h3>
            <video controls src="The Bed.mp4" width="500"></video>
            <p>Life is vulnerable and precious, so I want to appreciate the people around me when it is too late. </p>
            <h3>The Thoughts</h3>
            <video controls src="Thoughts.mp4" width="500"></video>
            <p>As a person who has difficulties with communication and social anxiety, I found shoes are my escape to reality, and "The Thoughts" basically speak up my inner thoughts.</p>
            <h3>The Unholy</h3>
            <video controls src="The Unholy.mp4" width="500"></video>
            <p>This is like part 2 of "The Thoughts", as a person who grew up in a Catholic family, I can't fit in due to my unusual way of thinking and I'm also a lefty which according to the Catholic school where I used to study, I was considered as "slow" and hard to educate. That's why I found the church or anything related to Catholic a bit unpleasant.</p>
            <h3> Sam Is Your Good Friend</h3>
            <video controls src="SamIsYourGoodFriend.mp4" width="500"></video>
            <p>I can't fit in and friendship is something I consider as expensive.</p>
            <h3> Goth Girl</h3>
            <video controls src="Goth Girl.mp4" width="500"></video>
            <p>I like Goth Girls</p>
            <P>:3</P>
