        <h2>WEEK 2</h2>
        <h3> 1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <p>The visual of the Luni website is outstanding with 3D animation floating based on how the mouse moves. There are 5 slides total and each slide has its unique animation which rapidly boosts the website's aesthetic.</p>
        <h3> 2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
      <p> However, after spending more than 2 minutes playing around with the 3D models' animation, clicking the icons, and scrolling, through those activities I found something fairly interesting. </p>
        <h3> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>3D models displayed at the very beginning of the website are the hook that made me spend most of my time due to the animation and every single detail on each model is unique and based on the mouse movement that led to the change in animation itself.
        
    
    </p>
    <h3> 4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    <p>Most of the action I have texted on the website is clicking and scrolling and the website itself holds up pretty well even though there was slightly lagging. </p>
    <h3> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
    </h3>
    <p>The visual and browsing experience from this Luni is excellent, they have met and went beyond the expectation of a normal website, not boring and somehow quite entertaining to browse. </p>
      <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h3>
    <p>Their design language is focused on visuals, specifically 3D models and animation which make the interaction between users much more approachable and they tend to stay longer on the website.</p>
    <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
    <p>After spending more than 5 minutes on the website, I noticed the aliasing line of the 3D models is easily spotted after spending a bit more time browsing the website. Moreover, some slight lagging while scrolling the website might be caused by the animation and 3D models but it is not too annoying while browsing. 
    </p>
    <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
    <p>All information on this website is pretty straightforward which makes the browsing more approachable and every section has its animation and the way they arranged which part is quite creative.
    </p>
    <h2>WEEK 3</h2> 
<h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
<p>It gives the vibe of normal video games for kids to entertain, like diving into a digital playground through the Luni design concept.</p>
<h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
<p>Based on the design language of this platform, the only action I can do is play around with it and discover the hidden animation.</p>
<h3>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
<p>It is quite challenging to research this website because of the uniqueness of the website itself.</p>
<h3>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
<p>Mostly the 3D part is annoying due to the lag and the animation makes it even worse, however, this can be fixed by letting the website more time to load.</p>

<h3>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
      <p>Mini games is the most fun art about this website, specifically the basketball part which is very fun to play with.</p>
